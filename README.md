## Proof of the two problems mentioned in the introduction

We conducted additional experiments on FFHQ to Babies domain. We selected different data as reference datasets for calculating evaluation metrics. We selected FID as the evaluation metric. The experimental results are shown in the following table.

| method  | source domain dataset | target domain train dataset | target domain test dataset |
|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| MineGAN | 95.36                 | 27.53                       | 87.48                      |
| RSSA    | 45.32                 | 65.77                       | 66.81                      |
| Ours    | 50.67                 | 36.25                       | 37.16                      |
